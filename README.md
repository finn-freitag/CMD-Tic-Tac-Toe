# CMD-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a modular TicTacToe game.
It means that you could choose your opponent between this players:
1. a human player, interacting using the command line
2. a player that makes random moves (you can win very easily)
3. a player that tries not to lose (you can win easily)
4. a player using the MiniMax algorithm (you can't win)
5. an online player (yes, it's a multiplayer game, you can host a server)

Furthermore, you can mix players, I think a good mix is 'PlayerMiniMax' (4.) and 'PlayerPreventWin' (3.). That makes winning possible, but it also makes smart moves. You can use 'PlayerStopwatch' to measure the time taken by a player.
